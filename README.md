In this repl I create a python program to check if your password has ever been part of a hack.

This program uses an API that compares first 5 hash characters of the password against their database, returns a list of all matches, then program compares the full password against received list.
Full password or full hashed password is never shared further.
As a result program is able to tell if your password has ever bene part of a hack an dhow often.
    *Give hello as a password and see what you receive.
